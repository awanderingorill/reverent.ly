Today world economy and social activities are becoming increasingly dependent on internet. The number of internet users worldwide has already surpassed 1.5 billion in 2009.

As internet service has spread worldwide, the U.S. is raking up the greatest profits through internet in name and reality by using it as a means for putting the world under its control.

The latest science and technology achieved by humankind is by no means a monopoly of the U.S. A great benefit of internet is a new medium for celebrating the revolutionary career and undying exploits of Kim Jong-un.
